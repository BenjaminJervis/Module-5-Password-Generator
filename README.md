# Module-5-Password-Generator

# Project Title
Create a password generator 

# Description
In this challenge, we were required to generate a random password based on user input. Firstly, I had to plan out what code was needed and the steps I would take to implement it so that the program would work correctly. 
The first thing I did was determine the variables I needed and create them. Then I created confirm statements to give the user input choices, so that they could firstly determine the length of their required password, and if they wanted to include upper case, lowercase and special charcters and also include numbers if they wanted too. 

I decided to create several variables and used conditions If statements based on user input. I also added Alert to make sure the user entered the correct choices. 
From this I used a for loop and Math.floor and Math.random to select a random elements from the given arrays. 
I then used the given code to make the password display in the text screen. 

# Getting Started

To help get started we were provided with arrays which contained various elements including uppercase, lowercase, special and number characters in the starter/index.js file. I used the elements to generate certain outcomes based on the requirements ReadMe file. Firstly I created a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, cloned it to my computer. I then copied the starter files to my local git repository.

I used VS code, Git Hub and HTML

# Help
I used the tutorial service and ask BCS to work out the requirements for the loop and to get help with the structure of code layout.
